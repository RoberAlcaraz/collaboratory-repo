# Collaboratory Repository

This repository is for teammates to play and collaborate, learning the basics of Git & GitHub.

The data used in this activity is from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/felipeesc/shark-attack-dataset

## Activities

Follow these steps to complete the collaborative exercise:

1. **Repo Setup (Person A)**
   - Create a new GitHub repository.
   - Clone it locally and initialize the project structure:
     - `data/`
     - `scripts/`
     - `README.md`
   - Push the initial structure to the `main` branch.

2. **Add Dummy Data (Person B)**
   - Clone the repo and create a new branch for adding data.
   - Populate the `data/` folder with a small sample CSV.
   - Push the branch and open a Pull Request into `main`.

3. **Add Processing Script (Person C)**
   - Sync with the latest `main`, then create a branch for the script.
   - Write a simple script in `scripts/` that reads and plots the data.
   - Push the branch and open a Pull Request into `main`.

4. **Code Review & Merge (All)**
   - Review each other's Pull Requests on GitHub; add comments if needed.
   - Merge PRs in the correct order, and pull the updated `main` branch back to local clones.

5. **Conflict Simulation (Person B & C)**
   - Both edit the same line in `README.md`â€”one locally, one via GitHub web.
   - Attempt to pull/merge to trigger a conflict, then resolve it together.

6. **History Exploration & Revert (All)**
   - Inspect the full commit history with a graphical view.
   - Identify a past commit, revert it in a new branch, open a PR for the revert, and merge.

Happy Collaborating!
